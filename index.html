          <p>
            Since July 2013 I have been an employed Domestic Energy Assessor working for <a href="https://www.auragas.co.uk">Aura Gas Ltd</a>. My role is diverse from completing surveys in customer’s homes to developing new systems and procedures in
            the
            office. My job title changed to Compliance
            And Support Officer to reflect my changing role in the team and I am now responsible for pricing (ours and monitoring competitors), managing our quoting tool, invoice checking, monitoring surveys produced by other surveyors and
            maintaining
            office
            data recording including complex Excel spreadsheets I developed to record margin by job type, surveyor, engineer and a host of other recording tools all developed or improved upon by me. I have also just managed the successful migration
            of
            our
            CRM
            from an externally managed provider to a new self-managed system which I configured ready for use including setting up e-mail parsers, establishing reporting and automating these, automated e-mails and workflows based on job actions, data
            analytics
            and KPI and target monitoring.
